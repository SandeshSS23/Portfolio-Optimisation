This project focuses on optimizing financial portfolios by soliciting user input for a list of stocks in which to invest. The objective is to provide users with an optimal percentage allocation for each stock, thereby maximizing potential returns. The underlying algorithm employed for this purpose is the genetic algorithm. This approach aims to enhance the efficiency of portfolio construction by leveraging genetic principles to iteratively refine investment strategies. The end result is a carefully curated portfolio allocation, tailored to achieve the highest possible returns based on the user's specified stock selection.
